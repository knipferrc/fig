<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Everytime you got to start a new project you have to create a bunch of config files and they are normally the same every single time. Its boring, time consuming, and well, not fun. Fig is here to help, it writes them for you.

### Built With

- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Currently Fig is only available by cloning this repo and building fig yourself and then putting it in your path.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/knipferrc/fig.git
```

2. Build using nimble

```sh
nimble -d:ssl build fig
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Currently this only supports a few different config files used mostly in web projects. Hopefully with different templates and more to come later.

To run fig, just use the following command and it will start writing files.

```
fig -d
```
